class=\"p1\"><b>Policy Purpose<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p2\">The purpose of this policy (the \u201c<b>Conflicts Policy\u201d<\/b>) is to inform clients and regulators how Simply Digital Technologies Inc (<b>\u201cCoinSmart\u201d<\/b>) identifies and manages potential conflicts of interest.<\/p><p class=\"p3\"><b>Introduction<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p2\">CoinSmart is a Crypto Asset Trading Platform (<b>\u201cCTP\u201d<\/b>) and operates a proprietary platform (the <b>\u201cPlatform\u201d<\/b>) that enables users to buy, sell, hold, withdraw and deposit crypto assets that are not themselves securities and\/or derivatives (collectively, the <b>\u201cCrypto Assets\u201d<\/b>). The Platform is made available through CoinSmart\u2019s website and mobile application. CoinSmart is registered in all provinces and territories in Canada as a Restricted Dealer and Marketplace. CoinSmart\u2019s principal regulator is the Ontario Securities Commission.<\/p><p class=\"p3\"><b>Regulatory Background<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p4\">As a result of CoinSmart\u2019s marketplace registration, the firm factors in applicable securities laws that require marketplaces to establish, maintain and ensure compliance with policies and procedures that identify and manage conflicts of interest arising from the operation of the marketplace or the services the marketplace provides. Such conflicts may include those, actual or perceived, which are related to: (i) the commercial interests of the marketplace; (ii) the interest of the marketplace\u2019s owners or operators; (iii) referral arrangements; and (iv) the responsibilities and sound functioning of the marketplace.<\/p><p class=\"p4\">Additionally, as CoinSmart is registered as a restricted dealer the firm factors in applicable securities laws require restricted dealers to: (i) identify existing and reasonably foreseeable material conflicts of interest between a Client and<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>or any individual acting on \u2019s behalf; (ii) address all material conflicts of interest in the best interests of the Client; (iii) avoid material conflicts of interest that cannot be otherwise addressed in the best interests of the Client; and (iv) provide affected Clients with disclosure of material conflicts of interest at account opening or in a timely manner if they are identified later.<\/p><p class=\"p4\">CoinSmart is required to supervise how existing or potential material conflicts of interest between the Approved Person and the client are addressed. All CoinSmart personnel, including members of the Board of Directors, must disclose any outside activities to Compliance which is reviewed and approved at least annually. Individuals are required to consider and address any existing or potential material conflicts of interest between the individual and CoinSmart and between the individual and CoinSmart\u2019s client(s). If the issue cannot be addressed via written client consent or disclosure, the outside activity will be denied and must be avoided.<\/p><p class=\"p2\">CoinSmart recognizes that carrying out a marketplace and a restricted dealer business as divisions of the same corporate entity may be a source of confusion and perceived conflict and has addressed those conflicts through disclosure by CoinSmart to its client and through segregation of personnel and their responsibilities and access. We further recognize that conflicts may arise as a result of future business development and\/or regulatory changes. Consequently, this Conflicts Policy may be amended from time to time to address such changes.<\/p><p class=\"p3\"><b>Conflict Identification and Management<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p4\">The management of all potential conflicts of interest is taken very seriously at CoinSmart. Consequently, CoinSmart operates with an eye to maintaining a robust level of ethics and integrity. To do so,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>CoinSmart operates in a fair, orderly and transparent manner, addressing the following subject matter:<\/p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li5\">Identifying Conflicts<\/li><li class=\"li5\">Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest<\/li><li class=\"li5\">Avoiding or Addressing Conflicts of Interest in the Best Interest of Clients<\/li><li class=\"li5\">Onership: CoinSmart<\/li><li class=\"li5\">Distinguishing Commercial Activity from Supervisory, Finance and Compliance Oversight<\/li><li class=\"li6\">Personal Dealings: Personal Trading, Outside Business Activities, Gifting &amp; Entertainment<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"p3\"><b>Identifying Conflicts<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p4\">It is important to have a means to properly identify and address situations wherein even unintended conflicts may arise. In all cases,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>employees, officers and directors and any employees, officers, directors or contractors of any<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>outsourced service provider working directly on behalf of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>(collectively, <b>\u201c Personnel\u201d<\/b>) are required to adhere to any and all CoinSmart\u2019s applicable conflicts-related policies and procedures. This is captured and attested to on an annual basis as part of<b><i> CoinSmart\u2019s Ethical Code of Employees<\/i><\/b>. CoinSmart reviews potential conflicts of interest regularly, and at least annually, as part of the annual Compliance report to the Board of Directors.<\/p><p class=\"p4\">At a minimum, whenever a new business line or relationship is considered, and whenever a senior officer\u2019s participation on the board of, or as a senior officer of, another corporate entity creates any new potential, actual, or perceived conflict, CoinSmart\u2019s Ultimate Designated Person (<b>\u201cUDP\u201d)<\/b> shall consider whether or not there is any actual material conflict of interest with CoinSmart, any of its business units, affiliates, or clients. CoinSmart\u2019s Compliance department shall maintain a registry of all possible conflicts, and note how they were addressed, either by disclosure, avoidance, or otherwise and, as applicable, every outside business activity of CoinSmart by a CoinSmart officer or employee shall be disclosed to, and supervised by CoinSmart\u2019s Compliance department in accordance with the procedures described in the <b><i>Outside Business Activities \u2013 Desk Procedure<\/i><\/b>; and with respect to directors specifically, additional procedures shall apply in accordance with the Board of Directors Conflict of Interest Policy .<\/p><p class=\"p8\"><b>Disclosure Of Conflicts of Interest<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p4\">Unless avoided, an existing or potential material conflict of interest must be disclosed to the client in all cases where a reasonable client would expect to be informed:\u00a0<\/p><ol class=\"ol1\"><li class=\"li5\">for new clients, prior to opening an account for the client; and\u00a0<\/li><li class=\"li5\">for existing clients, either as the conflict of interest occurs or, in the case of a transaction related conflict of interest, prior to entering into the transaction with the client.<\/li><li class=\"li9\">CoinSmart will also disclose on the CoinSmart website any applicable conflicts in the CoinSmart Relationship Disclosure Information.<\/li><\/ol><p class=\"p2\">Generally, a conflict of interest is considered material if the conflict may be reasonably expected to influence either a Client\u2019s decisions or \u2019s or its representatives\u2019 recommendations or decisions in the circumstances.<\/p><p class=\"p3\"><b>Ownership<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p4\">CoinSmart is wholly owned by Simply Digital Technologies Inc.
